# Baseball Savant R Shiny App

https://agold1.shinyapps.io/BaseballApp/

The purpose of this app was to become familiar with how the R Shiny package functions and to create a simple platform meant for scouting and player development. All the data was downloaded from Baseball Savant using the MVP and Cy Young finalists from the 2020 season. On the first tab, you can see two heat maps, one for the pitcher and one for the hitter. By changing your selection on the tab panel to the left, you will get updated heat maps based on the selected player, pitch type, and result. For example, if you wanted to see where you could strikeout Jose Ramirez with a fastball, you can select Ramirez, Pitch Type: Fastball, and Select Hitter result: Strikeout, and the heat map will update. You can also compare the pitcher-hitter matchup you want to see. For example, you can use the heat maps to determine how Yu Darvish should pitch to Jose Ramirez. You could also focus on just one heatmap to determine what pitches a player is struggling with, then have your coaching staff create a plan to improve. On the second tab labeled "Metrics", we can see the advanced metrics for both the hitters and pitchers. This allows those who are more familiar with analytics to look at the raw data, whereas players that are visual learners can stick with the heat maps or vice versa.
